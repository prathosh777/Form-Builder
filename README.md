# How to use
Open Create Form (/create)

Enter a form name.

Click Add Field and configure label/type/options/validations.

Reorder fields by dragging the handle on each item.

Save the form. Saving writes to localStorage and also saves a currentForm used by the preview page.

Preview (/preview)

The preview renders the latest currentForm.

All fields start empty (no default values).

Submit runs validations; errors show inline.

Reset clears inputs.

My Forms (/myforms)

See saved forms (name, createdAt, number of fields).

Preview a saved form (sets currentForm).

Duplicate or delete (delete shows themed modal).
